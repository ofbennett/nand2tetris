# Nand2Tetris

These are my solutions to the projects in the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) course. The accompanying textbook is [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://www.nand2tetris.org/book), by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.

The course involves building a computer computer system from first principles. You start at the level of basic logic gates, working your way up to chip sets and the CPU and RAM. Then you write an assembler to produce machine code, a virtual machine to produce assembly, and finally a compiler to translate a high level programming language into byte code for the virtual machine. Each step in the process adds a layer of abstraction on top of what was built in the previous step. As a final step you write a basic operating system to provide an environment in which to run programs. This OS provides programs with convenient access to graphics, keyboard input, dynamically allocated memory etc.

In the end I got a version of the game Pong working, on an operating system I built myself, compiled down to machine code with a compiler I wrote myself, run on a (virtual) CPU and RAM setup I built myself!
