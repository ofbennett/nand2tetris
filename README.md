# Nand2Tetris

These are my solutions to the projects in the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) course. The accompanying textbook is [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://www.nand2tetris.org/book), by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.

The course involves gradually building a computer system from first principles. You start at the level of basic logic gates, after which you move up to chip sets, the CPU and the RAM. Once the (virtual) hardware is setup and working you move on to the software. You write an assembler to produce machine code, a virtual machine to produce assembly, and finally a compiler to translate a high-level programming language into a lower-level VM language for the virtual machine. Each step in the process adds a layer of abstraction on top of what was built in previous steps. As a final step, you write a basic operating system to provide programs with convenient access to things like graphics, keyboard input, dynamic memory allocation etc.

In the end I got a version of the game Pong working, on an operating system I built myself, compiled down to machine code with a compiler I wrote myself, run on a (virtual) CPU and RAM setup I built myself!
